    "title": "Zotero: Advantages and Disadvantages",
    "section": "Disadvantages of Zotero",
    "text": "Disadvantages of Zotero\n\nSteep learning curve for advanced features\nWhile Zotero’s basic features are user-friendly, some of the advanced functionalities may present a steep learning curve for new users, potentially discouraging their long-term usage. Tasks like creating and implementing a tagging system and configuring a syncing setup, particularly with other cloud solutions like Google Drive or Dropbox, can be challenging for beginners.\nAdditionally, setting up and using plugins such as Better BibTeX for Zotero - a tool for renaming citation keys, and Zotfile - a plugin for automated PDF management and syncing to mobile devices, may require a higher level of technical expertise.\nThe note-taking feature in Zotero can also be challenging for some users, as the note-taker interface is more suited to those familiar with writing within text-blocks, which might not be as fluid as using tools like Microsoft Word.\n\n\nOccasional bugs and glitches\nAs with any software, Zotero is not immune to occasional bugs, which users may encounter, especially in beta updates. While the Zotero team continuously works to improve the software, these updates can sometimes lead to unexpected issues.\nAdditionally, Some users have also experienced slowing down of zotero, particularly when handling large zotero libraries. One potential cause for this slowdown is the full-text indexing process, which may be resource-intensive for larger collections of research resources.\nIt’s important to note that such issues are not unique to Zotero and are common occurrences in software development. The Zotero community actively engages in discussions and forums to address and troubleshoot these challenges, and the development team diligently works to provide timely updates and improvements.\n\n\nLimited storage for free accounts\nIndeed, users with free Zotero accounts have a limitation of 300 MB for online or sync storage. This allocation is typically ample for syncing metadata, notes, and annotations. However, if users intend to utilize the storage for backing up or syncing larger files like PDFs, EPUBs, or images, the free storage might prove insufficient.\nTo address this limitation, Zotero provides an option to purchase a yearly subscription with varying storage capacities, such as 2 GB, 6 GB, or even unlimited storage, catering to diverse user needs.\nAlternatively, Zotero offers solutions for users to utilize other cloud storage services, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, for backing up or syncing their files across multiple devices. This integration allows users to leverage additional cloud storage options to accommodate their individual requirements while utilizing Zotero’s powerful citation management features.\n\n\nCannot annotate web-clips and video-clips\nZotero’s web clipper feature is highly beneficial as it allows users to capture webpages and create snapshots of visited websites. This functionality proves invaluable because websites often undergo updates or may go offline after the initial visit. With the snapshot feature, users can preserve an archive of the webpage as it appeared on the date of the visit, ensuring access to the original information.\nMoreover, the snapshot retains embedded links, enabling users to access linked pages even if the original website becomes unavailable.\nHowever, one challenge is that these snapshots cannot be directly opened within Zotero, limiting note-taking and annotation capabilities in a manner similar to PDFs. To work around this limitation, users may need to rely on external web-based tools for annotation and note-taking, which may involve a tedious process of copying the notes to Zotero. Another workaround is for users to print webpages as PDFs and then annotate and take notes within Zotero using the PDF format of the webpage. While functional, this process is not as seamless as native note-taking within Zotero.\nThe same challenge applies to note-taking for video clips captured with Zotero’s web clipper. Playing the videos within Zotero or directly from a web browser with a Zotero extension for seamless note-taking linked to the related file within Zotero is currently not possible.\n\n\nNo simple solution to bulk merging or deleting of research resource duplicates\nZotero offers a helpful built-in functionality to identify and view duplicated metadata within a dedicated duplicates folder or collection. This feature proves especially valuable when dealing with imports of duplicate files or metadata. This is a common occurrence when such performing literature search using identical search terms/parameters across multiple literature databases.\nBy accessing the duplicates collection, users can conveniently identify and merge or delete duplicates. However, the current process of deleting or merging duplicates is limited to deleting or merging duplicates for one research resource at a time. Consequently, when dealing with a substantial number of duplicates, merging or deleting them individually can become time-consuming and tedious.\nAs a workaround, some users have resorted to using JavaScript code to automatically click the merge files button multiple times (e.g., 100 times) to streamline the merging process. Although functional, this approach is considered clunky and lacks an optimal user experience.\n\n\nSaved searches cannot be grouped, moved or nested\nIn Zotero, all saved searches are displayed at the bottom of the user-created collections, and unfortunately, they cannot be moved, nested, or grouped with other collections or saved searches. As a result, organizing and categorizing saved searches can be somewhat limited.\nThe ability to group saved searches would indeed be a valuable aesthetic enhancement within Zotero. This feature could offer users greater flexibility and organization, allowing them to create a more cohesive and user-friendly workspace.\nThere remains hope that in future updates, the addition of the ability to group saved searches will be considered and implemented, enhancing the overall user experience and organizational capabilities within Zotero.\n\n\nHighlighter does not work in split pane\nOne of the most valuable capabilities of Zotero is the ability to highlight and annotate pdf text. However, this functionality does not work on the second split pane. This means that when using the split pane feature to view two sections of a document simultaneously, the ability to highlight and annotate text is limited to the first pane only."

While not curative, ART enables individuals with HIV to lead longer, healthier lives and reduces the risk of transmission. Successful ART entails treatment support, including monitoring and providing interventions as needed to sustain treatment efficacy3.↩︎\nViral suppression, achieved through ART, entails low viral load resulting from suppressed viral replication. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines viral suppression as having fewer than 200 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood, while the World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as fewer than 1000 copies per milliliter. This benchmark signifies effective treatment in controlling HIV replication and reducing the risk of transmission.4,5.↩︎\nThe six countries are Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, Eswatini and Zambia↩︎\nThe 11 countries are Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, Eswatini, Zambia, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Lesotho↩︎\nThe belief that HIV testing is for people who acted immorally creates negative attitudes towards testing. Unfortunately, HIV is unfairly associated with specific groups such as men who have sex with men or drug users. Such stigma can lead to discriminatory practices at work, health centers and within communities that PLWH resides. Some countries criminalize HIV transmission and HIV exposure which may discourage people from testing or seeking treatment.13.↩︎\nSocioeconomic disparities impact HIV testing and access to ART for PLWH from low-income backgrounds. Low-income jobs often necessitate daily wages for subsistence, making it difficult to take time off for treatment. Additionally, distant treatment centers incur travel expenses, further straining tight budgets. These challenges hinder PLWH from low-income households from initiating or maintaining ART care. This phenomenon may contribute to men’s lower engagement with ART due to financial responsibilities. However, studies suggest minimal differences in HIV testing and ART use between low and high-income PLWH. High-income individuals may avoid testing and treatment due to fear of stigma, discrimination and losing social status, while low-income individuals face financial barriers to ART care acquisition.14,15.↩︎\nHIV testing and viral suppression rates are lower among males, while youth, particularly young women, exhibit reduced likelihood of testing and linking to ART care. Stigma surrounding sexuality, legal constraints, and societal barriers contribute to this trend among young women. Additionally, the transient living arrangements of youth and male demographics, often driven by employment mobility, further hinders linkage and sustained ART care. Children and adolescents also demonstrate low rates of testing, ART coverage, and viral suppression, highlighting challenges in reaching these populations with effective HIV services14,16.  Access to ART remains challenging, especially in high HIV burden regions, where countries often rely on foreign companies for antiretroviral drugs. However, inefficient drug supply chains contribute to deficient distribution and stock-outs, potentially allowing counterfeit drugs to infiltrate the supply chain. Weak regulatory policies and corruption further complicate efforts to eliminate counterfeit drugs, leading to lapses in adherence among PLWH on ART. Consequently, this impacts the percentages of individuals on ART and achieving viral suppression17,18. Access to ART care is hindered by a shortage of skilled healthcare providers, particularly in low and middle-income countries. The talent drain to high-income countries exacerbates this challenge, leaving the available healthcare workforce overworked. Consequently, patients face limited access to treatment centers, often necessitating travel to overcrowded facilities, further straining the healthcare system17.↩︎\nEclipse phase is a period that occurs within the first days to weeks after HIV acquisition. During this phase, HIV is not detectable in plasma. Acute HIV is the phase of infection that occurs shortly after eclipse phase when HIV-1 is detectable but antibody respose is not present. These two phases are characterized by exponential viral growth and elevated viral loads. Initiating ART during these phases is crucial to not only prevents further immune system deterioration but also curtail the likelihood of onward HIV transmission20.↩︎"

    "text": "Five use-cases for using Markdown Editors in Long-form Academic Document Composition\n\nWhat are markdown editors?\nIf you are looking for a way to write faster, easier and better, you might want to consider using a markdown editor. A markdown editor is a software that lets you write in plain text and apply formatting with simple symbols. For example, you can use asterisks to make text bold or italic, or use hashtags to create headings. You can write and format your text in the editor mode, and then preview the final result in the preview mode.\nThere are dedicated markdown editors such as obsidian and typora which are largely used by creative and technical writers with minimal software programming background. However, some integrated development environment (IDE) like RStudio and visual studio are used as markdown editors particularly among technical writers with software programming background for code and software documentation. Most markdown formatting will work across most markdown editors however some markdown formatting are unique to the specific editors.\nMarkdown editors are different from the traditional word processors that most of us are familiar with, such as Microsoft Word. These word processors are based on the principle of “what you see is what you get” (WYSIWYG), which means that you see the formatting as you type. However, this can also be distracting and cumbersome, especially when you are working on long and complex documents.\nIn this blog post, I will give a 5 use-cases where markdown editors can help you write better long form academic documents.\n\n\n1. Increased productivity through simplified formatting\nLike most graduate students, i was well-acquainted with the ubiquitous Microsoft Word. While Word offers familiarity, accessibility through university accounts, and a range of features, it can be burdensome when it comes to formatting long documents. For instance:\n\nInserting or updating images or tables often necessitates manual adjustments in Word, including resizing and spacing corrections to maintain the document’s visual harmony.\nCopying and pasting text from various sources into Word frequently carries over formatting inconsistencies, leading to formatting discrepancies in the final document.\n\nThese challenges are undoubtedly familiar to anyone who has undertaken long-form writing projects. Please share your experiences or other similar examples in the comments below.\nIn contrast, Markdown-based tools offer an elegant solution. A simple line of code effortlessly maintains formatting consistency, regardless of the number of revisions. Markdown editors automatically update figure numbers when images are added, and all pasted text is stripped of extraneous formatting. Sub-chapters can be seamlessly reorganized, added, or removed, with automatic chapter numbering of the final document. Markdown editors empowers writers to focus their precious time on the actual writing, sparing them the drudgery of managing formatting intricacies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Markdown formatted document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) PDF printout of document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This is an example of automatic numbering of chapter headings and figure captions within markdown\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Seamless Integration of Publication-Ready Images\nConventional word processors often fall short when handling images generated from data analysis tools. These images at times may appear blurry, exhibit poor color contrast, or present image text in smaller fonts. Flow charts and schematic diagrams can be particularly troublesome, as they tend to shift or lose elements particularly when document containing them are shared among collaborators or supervisors. Let me know in the comments section if anything like this has ever happened to you.\nRStudio, a powerful data visualization tool and markdown editor, offers an elegant solution. The tool allows authors to draft text alongside the code that generates images, facilitating real-time image adjustments within the markdown environment.\nWhile creating flow charts and schematic diagrams in a traditional word processor may be straightforward, markdown editors typically incorporate tools like mermaid.js, that reduces time spent in creating and editing complex flow charts with plain text. This approach, though requiring some familiarity with mermaid syntax, streamlines the creation of intricate flow charts in a matter of minutes.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(DiagrammeR)\n\n\nmermaid(\"graph LR\n  subgraph Preparation\n  A((Start))--&gt; B(Step 1)\n  end\n  subgraph Execution\n  B --&gt; C{Step 2}\n  C --&gt; D(Step 3)\n  E(Step 4) --&gt; F(Step 5)\n  end\n  subgraph Conclusion\n  C --&gt; G(Step 6)\n  F--&gt; H[Step 7]\n  end\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This is an example of a flow digram generated in RStudio using the code chuck above. This also illustrates how data analysis outputs can be easily inserted within writeup and updated within the same environment as your writeup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Enhanced Reproducibility\nData analysis and writing are iterative processes, often involving multiple rounds of revising and refining data and writing outputs. When it comes to data analysis, additional data may become available after initial data analysis and report drafting, which may necessitate reanalysis of data or even new analysis. Managing these evolving datasets can be complex and error-prone, especially when managing different data files over time while not having good data management practices.\nIn addition, during long-form writing, numerous unformed ideas can be captured as notes within earlier document drafts which might require revisions or supporting evidence. The conventional method to manage these unformed ideas is to color-highlight these text and editing them later or deleting them (Figure 3 (c)). If you employ other methods for managing unformed ideas, please share in the comments section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) commenting in RStudio. The dark blue text is commented out using html commenting syntax and will be absent in the printed or rendered final document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Commenting in obsidian. Obsidian is a popular note-taking markdown editor that uses html as well as obsidian flavored markdown comment syntax. Obsidian flavored markdown comments might be visible in some rendered output formats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Commenting in Word. The text containing the unformed ideas is highlighted with yellow highlight and a comment added to reference action to be taken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Different ways to comment out unformed ideas within long-form write-ups\n\n\n\nHowever, deleting or editing these unformed ideas might leave you in a situation where you might need these ideas at a later date. An alternative way to managing this using markdown editors is to comment out these unformed ideas within your writing. This allows you to refer to them during later revisions however not have them visible within your printed or rendered document.\nAnother alternative is to use version control. Markdown editors, when coupled with Git and GitHub for version control, offer a powerful solution for tracking document changes. This approach allows you to have all your data analysis and writing consolidated within a single location and have historical versions of the document preserved for reference. With Git’s version control capabilities, authors can effectively manage evolving data and track changes across different document drafts.\n\n\n4. Chapter referencing\nWord while compatible with citation managers like Mendeley or Zotero, it can encounter challenges when inserting chapter-specific references at the end of each chapter within a long-form document. To facilitate insertion of references at the end of each chapter, authors often resort to creating separate chapter documents, risking citation duplications.\nMarkdown editors can circumvent this issue through using specific YAML code. The code instructs the editor to aggregate all the references cited within the specific chapter at the end of the chapter. This approach eliminates the risk of duplicated references within a single document, providing a cleaner and more accurate reference list.\n\n\n5. Document repurposing and LaTeX Support\nMarkdown editors offer effortless file conversion of a single document into various document formats using pandoc file conversion. Authors can generate research grant reports, presentations, books, or manuscripts from the same source file with minimal adjustments. This approach saves time and ensures uniformity in message communicated.\nAdditionally, markdown editors often incorporate pandoc plugins and MathJax, to simplify the inclusion of mathematical formulas and equations. Beautifully typeset LaTeX documents can be easily generated while retaining mathematical formatting via pandoc conversion with the assistance of packages like TinyTex or programs like MikTeX. This feature is particularly beneficial for researchers with scientific backgrounds that frequently use mathematical symbols and equations as part of their regular write-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\nThis  \\(Persons \\; infected = \\frac{(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{liter \\; wastewater})* (\\frac{liter \\; wastewater}{days})}{(\\frac{g \\; feces}{person-day})*(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{g \\; feces})}\\)1 is an example of an equation written within a sentence.\n  This \\[Persons \\; infected = \\frac{(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{liter \\; wastewater})* (\\frac{liter \\; wastewater}{days})}{(\\frac{g \\; feces}{person-day})*(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{g \\; feces})}\\] is the same equation written between paragraphs.\n   # Syntax for above equation\n\n  Persons \\; infected = \\frac{(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{liter \\; wastewater})*     (\\frac{liter \\; wastewater}{days})}{(\\frac{g \\;feces}{person-day})*(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{g \\; feces})}\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\nThis  \\(L_T(\\vec{\\lambda})=\\sum_{(x,s)}\\log P{(s|x)}-\\sum_{i=1}^m\\frac{\\lambda_i^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\) is an example of a mathematical equation written within a sentence.\n \nThis \\[L_T(\\vec{\\lambda})=\\sum_{(x,s)}\\log P{(s|x)}-\\sum_{i=1}^m\n\\frac{\\lambda_i^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\] is the same equation written between paragraphs.\n # Syntax for above equation\n\n  L_T(\\vec{\\lambda})=\\sum_{(x,s)}\\log P{(s|x)}-\\sum_{i=1}^m\\frac{\\lambda_i^2}{2\\sigma^2}"

    "section": "Steps to building the web application",
    "text": "Steps to building the web application\n\nStep 1. Data Acquisition and Preparation\nHIV incidence data was download from the World Health Organization data repository. The dataset contained estimates for HIV prevalence, AIDS-related deaths, new HIV infections for all countries from 1990 to 2021.\nThe data was downloaded as an excel file for the data repository. The imported excel file had multiple merged cells. The columns with country names, HIV-1 incidence estimates and years were extracted to a new sheet and saved as a csv file.\n\n\nStep 2: Data cleaning and preparation\nThe csv file was imported into Rstudio and the data was grouped by country. To map the data, longitude and latitude coordinate data for each country was added to the dataset.\n\n\nStep 3: Setting up the Shiny Environment and creating the app\nTo create the shiny app, a new file type for shiny web app was created and saved in a separate folder within the working environment.\nTo create the shiny app; 3 components were needed\n\nUser interface (UI) which represents the front end of the app which the end user sees and interact with.\nServer which represent the backend of the shiny app which computes the required outputs based on the input given by the end user.\nThe shiny interface which bridges the ui and server.\n\nIn this example, the UI was made of a sidebar and main panel. The main panel had 2 tabs. The first tab shows an interactive map and with a slider for years ranging from 1990 t0 2021. Moving the slider across the year range by one level results in the map adjusting to reflect the HIV-incidence for that year. The second tab showed a graph for HIV-1 incidence from 1990 to 2021 with a drop down menu for selecting country. Selecting a country from the drop down menu resulted in the graph adjusting to reflect HIV-incidence for that country.\nFor data to be correctly filtered when a user of the shiny web app slides the slider or the user selects a country from the drop-down menu, the data imputed to the server had to be converted to a reactive object. This was then used to create two reactive apps. The first app being a reactive leaflet map which filtered HIV-1 incidence based on the year selected. HIV-1 incidence estimates is presented as a blue circle super-imposed onto the country. The second reactive app is a reactive ggplot graph which is filtered based on the country selected by the user from the drop down menu.\nThe complete code for this shiny app is as shown below\n\n# install and load packages\n\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(utils)   \nlibrary(shiny)   ## package for interactive app\nlibrary(leaflet) ## package for map\nlibrary(ggplot2) ## package for generating graph\nlibrary(dplyr)   ## package for merging, grouping and filtering data\nlibrary(ggmap)  ## package for adding longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates \nlibrary(bslib) ## package for theming shiny ui \nlibrary(thematic) # package for theming shiny ggplot\n\n\n\n# import HIV data\nhiv_data &lt;- read.csv(\"ExcelFileInCSVformat.csv\")\n\n# manipulate data using dplyr\nhiv_data &lt;- hiv_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(country) \n\n# Generate dataset with longitudes and latititudes for each country of the world\n\nworld_map &lt;- map_data(\"world\")\n\n# Add latitudes and longitudes to hiv_data\nhiv_mapped_data &lt;- merge(world_map, hiv_data, by.x = \"region\", by.y = \"country\")\n\n# filter out rows that do not have HIV incidence estimates\nhiv_map_data1 &lt;- hiv_map_data %&gt;% filter(!is.na(hiv_map_data$incidence))\n\nhiv_map_data1 &lt;- hiv_map_data1 %&gt;% \n  group_by(region)\n\n\n# create shiny app\n\n\nthematic::thematic_shiny() ## This code adds the ui theme to ggplot\n\n## UI for shiny app\nui &lt;- fluidPage(theme = bs_theme(\n  bg = \"#B8BCC2\", \n  fg = \"#34373a\", \n  primary = \"blue\", \n  secondary = \"red\",\n  base_font = font_google(\"Roboto Condensed\")),\n  sidebarLayout(sidebarPanel(titlePanel((strong(\"HIV Incidence\"))), br(), em(\"HIV incidence data for all ages from 1990 to 2021 based on Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\"), h5(\"Data source:\"), h5(a(href=\"https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/\", \"Data Repository\")), width = 3),\n  mainPanel(\n  tabsetPanel(\n    tabPanel(h5(strong(\"HIV incidence per year\")), p(\" \"), sliderInput(\"year\", strong(\"Select year:\"), min = 1990, max = 2021, value = 1995, step = 1, sep = \"\", width = \"100%\"), leafletOutput(\"map\", width = \"100%\", height = \"375px\")),\n    tabPanel(h5(strong(\"HIV incidence per country\")), br(), selectInput(\"country\", strong(\"Select a country:\"), choices = sort(unique(hiv_data$country))), plotOutput(\"plot2\", width = \"100%\", height = \"400px\"))\n  )\n)\n))\n\n## Server for shiny app\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n   \n  \n## reactive data filtered by selected year\n  filtered_data &lt;- reactive({\n    hiv_data %&gt;% filter(year == input$year)\n  })\n  filtered_data2 &lt;- reactive({\n    hiv_map_data1 %&gt;% filter(region == input$region)\n  })\n  \n  \n  ## create map\n  output$map &lt;- renderLeaflet({\n    leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 1.7, width = \"500px\", height = \"700px\"))%&gt;%\n      addTiles() %&gt;% \n      fitBounds(lng1 = 160, lat1 = -180, lng2 = -100, lat2 = 180) %&gt;%\n      setMaxBounds(lng1 = 160, lat1 = -180, lng2 = -100, lat2 = 180) %&gt;% \n      setView(lng = 40, lat = 0, zoom = 2) %&gt;%\n      addProviderTiles(\"OpenStreetMap\") %&gt;%\n      setMaxBounds(lng1 = min(hiv_data$longitude), \n                   lat1 = min(hiv_data$latitude), \n                   lng2 = max(hiv_data$longitude), \n                   lat2 = max(hiv_data$longitude)) %&gt;%\n      #setView(0,0,2) %&gt;%\n      addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %&gt;%\n      clearBounds() %&gt;%\n      addCircleMarkers(data = filtered_data(), ~longitude, ~latitude, label = ~paste0(country, sep =\"  \", incidence), radius = ~incidence*2, color = \"blue\", fillOpacity = 0.4, stroke= FALSE, )\n  })\n  \n\n## create graph\n  \n  output$plot2 &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(data = hiv_data[hiv_data$country == input$country,], aes(x = year, y = incidence)) +\n      geom_line() +\n      ggtitle(paste(\"HIV incidence for\", input$country)) + \n      labs(x = \"Years\", y = \"HIV incidence (per 1000 uninfected populations)\") + theme(text=element_text(size=15), axis.title=element_text(size=15), plot.title=element_text(size=20)) \n    \n    \n  \n  }\n  )\n}\n\n\n# run shiny app\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Deploying and Sharing the Shiny\nThe app was then uploaded to my shinyapp.io server account for easy sharing of the app."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nSouth Africa introduced the “diagnose and treat” universal HIV treatment program in September 2016. This program enables all identified HIV-positive patients to immediately start first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the presence of drug-resistant (DR) viruses in the drug-naive population complicates the choice of ART. We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to determine the prevalence and diversity of HIV DR mutations in patients entering HIV treatment programs in northern South Africa. RNA was isolated from plasma of drug-naive HIV-1-infected patients. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, the HIV-1-pol gene comprising the complete protease (PR) and the first 900 bp of reverse transcriptase (RT) was amplified and sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq platform. Consensus sequences were derived at &gt;20% threshold and at &gt;5% threshold using Geneious PRIME® software version 2020.1.2. HIV-1 surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRM) were inferred using Calibrated Population Resistance tool in HIV Drug Resistance Database. Viral subtypes were determined using REGA and RIP genotyping tools. The HIV PR/RT region was successfully sequenced from 241 patients. From these, 23 (9.5%) had at least one SDRM detected at &gt;20% threshold, with a prevalence of 9.5% (n = 18), 3% (n = 7), and 0.4% (n = 1) for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and protease inhibitors (PI), respectively. The number of patients with SDRM increased to 31 (12.9%) when minority variants were accounted for at &gt;5% threshold. The most frequent SDRMs based on drug class were; K103N (7.9%-NNRTI), K65R (2.5%-NRTI), and D30N (0.8%-PI). Four cases of dual NRTI/NNRTI mutations were identified. All consensus sequences were subtype C, except three, which were C/A1, C/F1, and C/G recombinants. NGS analysis confirms that individuals entering HIV treatment programs in northern South Africa, habor moderate levels of SDRM, including cases of dual-class drug resistance. Further SDRM studies may be required to better understand resistance in the drug-naive population in the era of “diagnose and treat” in Limpopo Province, South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{ogola2022,\n  author = {Ogola, Bixa and Matume, Nontokozo and G.

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nBackground: In September 2016, South Africa introduced the universal HIV treatment programme, that is, ‘diagnose and treat.’ Transmission of drug resistant viruses complicates the choice of first line treatment regimen at the population level. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and diversity of HIV drug resistance mutations in patients entering HIV treatment programmes in northern South Africa.\nMethods: Proviral DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 257 of supposed drug naïve HIV-1 infected patients to entering treatment programmes in northern South Africa. A fragment of the HIV pol gene, comprising the complete protease and the first 421 amino acids of reverse transcriptase was amplified by nested PCR. Amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform. Consensus sequences were derived with minority variants cut-offs of &gt;20%-5% for each patient using Geneious® software version 8.1.5. HIV-1 drug resistance was inferred using the Calibrated Population Resistant (CPR) tool in HIV drug resistant database. Viral subtypes were determined using SCQUEL and RIP genotyping tools.\nResults: Quality sequences were obtained for 253/257 (98.4%) of the patients. About 9.5% (24/253) of the patients harboured at least one surveillance drug resistance mutation (SDRM). The proportion of resistance mutations to NNRTI, PI, and NRTI were 8.3%, 1.4% and 0.8% respectively. A majority (15/24; 62.5%) of the patients harbouring SDRM were females, between the ages 21-66 years, with median CD4+ cell count of 212/µl (range:50-811) and median viral load of 20,863 copies/mL (range: 20-696 474). The most frequent SDRM was K103N (75%; 18/24), and of these 5/12 were in males (41.7%). K103N is associated with high-level reduction in Nevirapine (NVP) and Efavirenz (EFV) susceptibility. Other mutations observed included: NNRTI: V106M (3/24), K101 (1/24), P225H (3/24); NRTI: 1/24 of each of M41L, K65R, M184V, F77L; PI: G73S (1/24), D30N (2/24), L90M (1/24). All sequences were HIV-1 subtype C on the Pol gene, except one which was HIV-1 subtype G.\nConclusion and Recommendation: These observations from NGS analysis suggest that the study population, entering HIV treatment programmes in northern South Africa, harboured moderate levels of transmitted drug resistance mutations. Drug resistance surveillance studies may be needed to better understand resistance in the drug naïve population in the era of ’diagnose and treat.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@inproceedings{ogola2019,\n  author = {Ogola, Bixa and Matume, Nontokozo and Bessong, Pascal},\n  publisher = {20th International Conference on AIDS and STDs in Africa\n    (ICASA)},\n  title = {Prevalence and Diversity of {HIV} Drug Resistance Mutations\n    in Patients Entering Treatment Program in {Northern} {South}\n    {Africa}},\n  date = {2019-12-02},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOgola, Bixa, Nontokozo Matume, and Pascal Bessong. 2019.\n“Prevalence and Diversity of HIV Drug Resistance Mutations in\nPatients Entering Treatment Program in Northern South Africa.”\nIn. 20th International Conference on AIDS and STDs in Africa (ICASA)."

    "section": "Focus of workshop",
    "text": "Focus of workshop\n\nResearch data collection and management\nThe significance of ethical practices in health research cannot be overstated. As researchers delve into complex scientific questions that engage with human subjects, it is imperative to uphold the highest ethical standards to protect the rights and well-being of individuals involved.\nOne of the focus of the training was on managing research data in terms of data protection, data sharing and data storage. The critical issue of handling sensitive and personal information of research participants was discussed. Researchers were provided with valuable insights into strategies for securely managing and protecting research data, while also emphasizing the importance of participant anonymity, confidentiality and appropriate data sharing and storage practices. Some of the challenges involved with data collection and management were discussed such as incomplete records, seeking informed consent and incompatible storage format. Focus was also given on the importance of implementing robust security measures to safeguard sensitive data such as de-identification techniques and access controls.\nThe workshop delved into the ethical protocols for handling and storing data linked to biological samples collected from study participants. These protocols were codified in the South Africa’s National Health Act of 2004. The legal framework governing collecting, storing and processing personal information in research settings provided by the South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) 4 of 2013 was discussed. This knowledge empowered researchers to maintain data integrity, ensure privacy, and comply with ethical principles.\n\n\nScientific misconduct and research integrity\nScientific misconduct poses a significant threat to the integrity of research outcomes. The different examples of scientific misconduct discussed were plagiarism, conflicts of interest, scientific bias, fabrication of data, ghost or guest authorship and conducting study without ethical clearance. These unethical practices undermine trust in scientific research and have far-reaching consequences. The workshop dedicated substantial attention to discussing the ethical responsibilities of researchers, emphasizing the importance of accurate reporting and raising awareness about the detrimental effects of scientific misconduct. Important guidelines for research integrity such as the Singapore statement on Research Integrity and the Hong Kong principles for Accessing researchers were mentioned. Thought provoking discussions were held around the ethical frameworks underpinning research integrity such as utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics. A number of principles for biomedical ethics were mentioned such as non-maleficence, beneficence and fairness. By cultivating a culture of scientific integrity, researchers are better equipped to contribute meaningfully to their field and establish credibility in their work.\n\n\nHistory of research ethics\nThe workshop also delved into the historical development of research ethics and the pivotal role of informed consent in health research. Informed consent stands as a fundamental principle, ensuring that participants have a comprehensive understanding of the study’s nature, potential risks and benefits, and their rights as research participants. The different types of informed consent and the specific considerations when obtaining consent from vulnerable populations were explored. Historical cases of unethical research were mentioned such as the Tuskegee syphillis study and the Tragedy from Thalidomide drug. The workshop aimed to provide researchers with the knowledge and tools to ethically engage with research participants and foster a relationship based on trust and respect.\n\n\n\nStudy participant and researcher happy with the informed consent process\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable populations\nLastly, the workshop acknowledged the ethical challenges involved when conducting research with vulnerable populations. These populations require special considerations due to their unique vulnerabilities and potential power imbalances. Example of vulnerable populations are the elderly, dependents, minors, prisoners or individuals with limited decision-making capacity. Vulnerability can be defined as cognitive, juridical, deferential, medical, infrastructural or allocational. The workshop provided researchers with ethical guidelines and best practices for conducting research with vulnerable populations, emphasizing the need to prioritize their rights, welfare, and autonomy. For example, when it came to seeking consent from minors, parental approval was required and it was recommended that the assent form should preferably contain images to express complex ideas.

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the Applied Ethics in Health Research Workshop aimed to foster an informed and ethically conscious research community by exploring critical topics related to data management, scientific misconduct, research integrity, informed consent, and the involvement of vulnerable populations. Through a comprehensive examination of these ethical considerations, the workshop sought to promote responsible and ethically sound practices in health research, thereby enhancing the generation of trustworthy and impactful research outcomes. By equipping participants with the necessary knowledge and tools, the workshop facilitated the development of an ethical research culture that upholds the rights, well-being, and dignity of all individuals involved in health research.\nI will be blogging on the different aspects of research ethics and if you are interested in the topic, leave a comment on aspects of research ethics that you would enjoy reading about.\n\n\n\nStudy participant and researcher happy with the informed consent process"
