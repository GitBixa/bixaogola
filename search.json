    "section": "Focus of workshop",
    "text": "Focus of workshop\n\nResearch data collection and management\nThe significance of ethical practices in health research cannot be overstated. As researchers delve into complex scientific questions that engage with human subjects, it is imperative to uphold the highest ethical standards to protect the rights and well-being of individuals involved.\nOne of the focus of the training was on managing research data in terms of data protection, data sharing and data storage. The critical issue of handling sensitive and personal information of research participants was discussed. Researchers were provided with valuable insights into strategies for securely managing and protecting research data, while also emphasizing the importance of participant anonymity, confidentiality and appropriate data sharing and storage practices. Some of the challenges involved with data collection and management were discussed such as incomplete records, seeking informed consent and incompatible storage format. Focus was also given on the importance of implementing robust security measures to safeguard sensitive data such as de-identification techniques and access controls.\nThe workshop delved into the ethical protocols for handling and storing data linked to biological samples collected from study participants. These protocols were codified in the South Africa’s National Health Act of 2004. The legal framework governing collecting, storing and processing personal information in research settings provided by the South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) 4 of 2013 was discussed. This knowledge empowered researchers to maintain data integrity, ensure privacy, and comply with ethical principles.\n\n\nScientific misconduct and research integrity\nScientific misconduct poses a significant threat to the integrity of research outcomes. The different examples of scientific misconduct discussed were plagiarism, conflicts of interest, scientific bias, fabrication of data, ghost or guest authorship and conducting study without ethical clearance. These unethical practices undermine trust in scientific research and have far-reaching consequences. The workshop dedicated substantial attention to discussing the ethical responsibilities of researchers, emphasizing the importance of accurate reporting and raising awareness about the detrimental effects of scientific misconduct. Important guidelines for research integrity such as the Singapore statement on Research Integrity and the Hong Kong principles for Accessing researchers were mentioned. Thought provoking discussions were held around the ethical frameworks underpinning research integrity such as utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics. A number of principles for biomedical ethics were mentioned such as non-maleficence, beneficence and fairness. By cultivating a culture of scientific integrity, researchers are better equipped to contribute meaningfully to their field and establish credibility in their work.\n\n\nHistory of research ethics\nThe workshop also delved into the historical development of research ethics and the pivotal role of informed consent in health research. Informed consent stands as a fundamental principle, ensuring that participants have a comprehensive understanding of the study’s nature, potential risks and benefits, and their rights as research participants. The different types of informed consent and the specific considerations when obtaining consent from vulnerable populations were explored. Historical cases of unethical research were mentioned such as the Tuskegee syphillis study and the Tragedy from Thalidomide drug. The workshop aimed to provide researchers with the knowledge and tools to ethically engage with research participants and foster a relationship based on trust and respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy participant and researcher happy with the informed consent process\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable populations\nLastly, the workshop acknowledged the ethical challenges involved when conducting research with vulnerable populations. These populations require special considerations due to their unique vulnerabilities and potential power imbalances. Example of vulnerable populations are the elderly, dependents, minors, prisoners or individuals with limited decision-making capacity. Vulnerability can be defined as cognitive, juridical, deferential, medical, infrastructural or allocational. The workshop provided researchers with ethical guidelines and best practices for conducting research with vulnerable populations, emphasizing the need to prioritize their rights, welfare, and autonomy. For example, when it came to seeking consent from minors, parental approval was required and it was recommended that the assent form should preferably contain images to express complex ideas. By integrating such considerations into their research endeavors, researchers can ensure that vulnerable populations are protected and empowered, ultimately contributing to more equitable and ethical health research practices."

    "title": " Prevalence and diversity of HIV drug resistance mutations in patients entering treatment program in Northern South Africa",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\nBackground: In September 2016, South Africa introduced the universal HIV treatment programme, that is, ‘diagnose and treat.’ Transmission of drug resistant viruses complicates the choice of first line treatment regimen at the population level. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and diversity of HIV drug resistance mutations in patients entering HIV treatment programmes in northern South Africa.\nMethods: Proviral DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 257 of supposed drug naïve HIV-1 infected patients to entering treatment programmes in northern South Africa. A fragment of the HIV pol gene, comprising the complete protease and the first 421 amino acids of reverse transcriptase was amplified by nested PCR. Amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform. Consensus sequences were derived with minority variants cut-offs of &gt;20%-5% for each patient using Geneious® software version 8.1.5. HIV-1 drug resistance was inferred using the Calibrated Population Resistant (CPR) tool in HIV drug resistant database. Viral subtypes were determined using SCQUEL and RIP genotyping tools.\nResults: Quality sequences were obtained for 253/257 (98.4%) of the patients. About 9.5% (24/253) of the patients harboured at least one surveillance drug resistance mutation (SDRM). The proportion of resistance mutations to NNRTI, PI, and NRTI were 8.3%, 1.4% and 0.8% respectively. A majority (15/24; 62.5%) of the patients harbouring SDRM were females, between the ages 21-66 years, with median CD4+ cell count of 212/µl (range:50-811) and median viral load of 20,863 copies/mL (range: 20-696 474). The most frequent SDRM was K103N (75%; 18/24), and of these 5/12 were in males (41.7%). K103N is associated with high-level reduction in Nevirapine (NVP) and Efavirenz (EFV) susceptibility. Other mutations observed included: NNRTI: V106M (3/24), K101 (1/24), P225H (3/24); NRTI: 1/24 of each of M41L, K65R, M184V, F77L; PI: G73S (1/24), D30N (2/24), L90M (1/24). All sequences were HIV-1 subtype C on the Pol gene, except one which was HIV-1 subtype G.\nConclusion and Recommendation: These observations from NGS analysis suggest that the study population, entering HIV treatment programmes in northern South Africa, harboured moderate levels of transmitted drug resistance mutations. Drug resistance surveillance studies may be needed to better understand resistance in the drug naïve population in the era of ’diagnose and treat.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@inproceedings{ogola2019,\n  author = {Ogola, Bixa and Matume, Nontokozo and Bessong, Pascal},\n  publisher = {20th International Conference on AIDS and STDs in Africa\n    (ICASA)},\n  title = {Prevalence and Diversity of {HIV} Drug Resistance Mutations\n    in Patients Entering Treatment Program in {Northern} {South}\n    {Africa}},\n  date = {2019-12-02},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOgola, Bixa, Nontokozo Matume, and Pascal Bessong. 2019.\n“Prevalence and Diversity of HIV Drug Resistance Mutations in\nPatients Entering Treatment Program in Northern South Africa.”\nIn. 20th International Conference on AIDS and STDs in Africa (ICASA)."

We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to determine the prevalence and diversity of HIV DR mutations in patients entering HIV treatment programs in northern South Africa. RNA was isolated from plasma of drug-naive HIV-1-infected patients. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, the HIV-1-pol gene comprising the complete protease (PR) and the first 900 bp of reverse transcriptase (RT) was amplified and sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq platform. Consensus sequences were derived at &gt;20% threshold and at &gt;5% threshold using Geneious PRIME® software version 2020.1.2. HIV-1 surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRM) were inferred using Calibrated Population Resistance tool in HIV Drug Resistance Database. Viral subtypes were determined using REGA and RIP genotyping tools. The HIV PR/RT region was successfully sequenced from 241 patients. From these, 23 (9.5%) had at least one SDRM detected at &gt;20% threshold, with a prevalence of 9.5% (n = 18), 3% (n = 7), and 0.4% (n = 1) for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and protease inhibitors (PI), respectively. The number of patients with SDRM increased to 31 (12.9%) when minority variants were accounted for at &gt;5% threshold. The most frequent SDRMs based on drug class were; K103N (7.9%-NNRTI), K65R (2.5%-NRTI), and D30N (0.8%-PI). Four cases of dual NRTI/NNRTI mutations were identified. All consensus sequences were subtype C, except three, which were C/A1, C/F1, and C/G recombinants. NGS analysis confirms that individuals entering HIV treatment programs in northern South Africa, habor moderate levels of SDRM, including cases of dual-class drug resistance. Further SDRM studies may be required to better understand resistance in the drug-naive population in the era of “diagnose and treat” in Limpopo Province, South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{ogola2022,\n  author = {Ogola, Bixa and Matume, Nontokozo and G.

    "section": "Advantages of Zotero",
    "text": "Advantages of Zotero\n\nFree and open-source software\nZotero’s appeal lies in its dual nature of being both free to use and open-source software. As an open-source tool, its code is freely accessible, allowing users to modify and adapt it according to their unique requirements. This openness has fostered a thriving community of users and developers who actively contribute to its ongoing development.\nFurthermore, the transparency of its open-source nature ensures enhanced data security. Users can scrutinize the code for any potential vulnerabilities or risks, which encourages a sense of confidence in the platform’s integrity. Should any issues arise, users can readily inform the developers or the wider community for prompt resolution.\nThe fact that Zotero is freely available makes it an attractive option, particularly for researchers and students who may have budget constraints and cannot afford paid citation managers. Its cost-effectiveness combined with its extensive functionality makes it a compelling choice for those seeking a comprehensive citation management solution.\n\n\nEasy to use and convenient\nOne of the most significant advantages of Zotero lies in its user-friendly and convenient interface. Its browser extensions enable seamless addition of references from various websites and databases, streamlining the process of collecting research resources. Additionally, the desktop application provides a hassle-free experience in organizing and citing references with ease. This user-centric design ensures researchers and students can efficiently manage their references and focus on their academic work without unnecessary complications.\n\n\nLarge community of users and developers\nThe open-source nature of Zotero has cultivated a vibrant community of users and developers who actively contribute to its evolution. This thriving community translates into a wealth of resources available for users, including online forums and comprehensive documentation. Platforms like the Zotero forum offer valuable assistance for users seeking solutions to challenges they may encounter. Additionally, the Zotero documentation serves as an invaluable resource for beginners, aiding in their familiarization with Zotero’s functionalities.\nThe presence of a vast user and developer base offers a key advantage in the rapid introduction of niche functionalities through plugins. As the core Zotero team focuses on planned developments, developers within the community can cater to specific, niche use cases desired by users.\n\n\nIntegration with various browsers and word processors\nZotero’s seamless integration with a variety of browsers and word processors enhances its usability for a diverse range of users. This versatile compatibility ensures that researchers and students can efficiently utilize Zotero regardless of their preferred browser or word processing software. Moreover, this integration fosters collaboration among individuals using different word processors, enabling smooth and efficient collaboration even among collaborators using different tools. This feature proves invaluable for research teams and academic projects, facilitating seamless cooperation and ensuring that all contributors can leverage the benefits of Zotero in their respective work environments.\n\n\nCitation styles\nZotero boasts an extensive selection of 10,382 citation styles, conveniently available through the Zotero Style Repository accessible from the preference tab of the Zotero desktop application. This vast collection caters to diverse academic requirements and ensures precise and accurate formatting of citations and bibliographies.\nFurthermore, Zotero provides users with a powerful Style Editor, enabling customization of citation styles from the repository or the creation of entirely new styles using the Citation Style Language (CSL). This feature empowers researchers to tailor citation styles to suit specific journal guidelines or institutional preferences, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of Zotero for a wide range of academic and professional contexts.\n\n\nTons of native functionalities\nZotero provides an efficient and comprehensive note-taking experience for researchers. While reading, users can highlight text using eight different colors and easily clip text and images, adding these clips to their notes. These highlights and annotations are saved as notes, which can be tagged and related to other notes or articles, enhancing organization and easy retrieval of information.\nOne remarkable feature is the drag-and-drop capability, allowing users to seamlessly transfer text within pdfs into Zotero’s note-taker while maintaining a linked citation to the original source. Consequently, all quoted text within the notes remains connected to the specific article being referenced.\nFor reading longer texts, Zotero offers a split-pane feature, enabling simultaneous viewing of two sections within the same document. This proves especially valuable when navigating books or articles, and when referencing specific sections without the need for excessive scrolling.\nUsers have the flexibility to adjust font size according to their preference, ensuring comfortable viewing of text. Additionally, wrapped scrolling allows for smooth and continuous reading without interruption, facilitating a seamless reading experience."

    "title": "Zotero: Advantages and Disadvantages",
    "section": "Disadvantages of Zotero",
    "text": "Disadvantages of Zotero\n\nSteep learning curve for advanced features\nWhile Zotero’s basic features are user-friendly, some of the advanced functionalities may present a steep learning curve for new users, potentially discouraging their long-term usage. Tasks like creating and implementing a tagging system and configuring a syncing setup, particularly with other cloud solutions like Google Drive or Dropbox, can be challenging for beginners.\nAdditionally, setting up and using plugins such as Better BibTeX for Zotero - a tool for renaming citation keys, and Zotfile - a plugin for automated PDF management and syncing to mobile devices, may require a higher level of technical expertise.\nThe note-taking feature in Zotero can also be challenging for some users, as the note-taker interface is more suited to those familiar with writing within text-blocks, which might not be as fluid as using tools like Microsoft Word.\n\n\nOccasional bugs and glitches\nAs with any software, Zotero is not immune to occasional bugs, which users may encounter, especially in beta updates. While the Zotero team continuously works to improve the software, these updates can sometimes lead to unexpected issues.\nAdditionally, Some users have also experienced slowing down of zotero, particularly when handling large zotero libraries. One potential cause for this slowdown is the full-text indexing process, which may be resource-intensive for larger collections of research resources.\nIt’s important to note that such issues are not unique to Zotero and are common occurrences in software development. The Zotero community actively engages in discussions and forums to address and troubleshoot these challenges, and the development team diligently works to provide timely updates and improvements.\n\n\nLimited storage for free accounts\nIndeed, users with free Zotero accounts have a limitation of 300 MB for online or sync storage. This allocation is typically ample for syncing metadata, notes, and annotations. However, if users intend to utilize the storage for backing up or syncing larger files like PDFs, EPUBs, or images, the free storage might prove insufficient.\nTo address this limitation, Zotero provides an option to purchase a yearly subscription with varying storage capacities, such as 2 GB, 6 GB, or even unlimited storage, catering to diverse user needs.\nAlternatively, Zotero offers solutions for users to utilize other cloud storage services, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, for backing up or syncing their files across multiple devices. This integration allows users to leverage additional cloud storage options to accommodate their individual requirements while utilizing Zotero’s powerful citation management features.\n\n\nCannot annotate web-clips and video-clips\nZotero’s web clipper feature is highly beneficial as it allows users to capture webpages and create snapshots of visited websites. This functionality proves invaluable because websites often undergo updates or may go offline after the initial visit. With the snapshot feature, users can preserve an archive of the webpage as it appeared on the date of the visit, ensuring access to the original information.\nMoreover, the snapshot retains embedded links, enabling users to access linked pages even if the original website becomes unavailable.\nHowever, one challenge is that these snapshots cannot be directly opened within Zotero, limiting note-taking and annotation capabilities in a manner similar to PDFs. To work around this limitation, users may need to rely on external web-based tools for annotation and note-taking, which may involve a tedious process of copying the notes to Zotero. Another workaround is for users to print webpages as PDFs and then annotate and take notes within Zotero using the PDF format of the webpage. While functional, this process is not as seamless as native note-taking within Zotero.\nThe same challenge applies to note-taking for video clips captured with Zotero’s web clipper. Playing the videos within Zotero or directly from a web browser with a Zotero extension for seamless note-taking linked to the related file within Zotero is currently not possible.\n\n\nNo simple solution to bulk merging or deleting of research resource duplicates\nZotero offers a helpful built-in functionality to identify and view duplicated metadata within a dedicated duplicates folder or collection. This feature proves especially valuable when dealing with imports of duplicate files or metadata. This is a common occurrence when such performing literature search using identical search terms/parameters across multiple literature databases.\nBy accessing the duplicates collection, users can conveniently identify and merge or delete duplicates. However, the current process of deleting or merging duplicates is limited to deleting or merging duplicates for one research resource at a time. Consequently, when dealing with a substantial number of duplicates, merging or deleting them individually can become time-consuming and tedious.\nAs a workaround, some users have resorted to using JavaScript code to automatically click the merge files button multiple times (e.g., 100 times) to streamline the merging process. Although functional, this approach is considered clunky and lacks an optimal user experience.\n\n\nSaved searches cannot be grouped, moved or nested\nIn Zotero, all saved searches are displayed at the bottom of the user-created collections, and unfortunately, they cannot be moved, nested, or grouped with other collections or saved searches. As a result, organizing and categorizing saved searches can be somewhat limited.\nThe ability to group saved searches would indeed be a valuable aesthetic enhancement within Zotero. This feature could offer users greater flexibility and organization, allowing them to create a more cohesive and user-friendly workspace.\nThere remains hope that in future updates, the addition of the ability to group saved searches will be considered and implemented, enhancing the overall user experience and organizational capabilities within Zotero.\n\n\nHighlighter does not work in split pane\nOne of the most valuable capabilities of Zotero is the ability to highlight and annotate pdf text. However, this functionality does not work on the second split pane. This means that when using the split pane feature to view two sections of a document simultaneously, the ability to highlight and annotate text is limited to the first pane only."

    "section": "Five use-cases for using Markdown Editors in Long-form Academic Document Composition",
    "text": "Five use-cases for using Markdown Editors in Long-form Academic Document Composition\n\nWhat are markdown editors?\nIf you are looking for a way to write faster, easier and better, you might want to consider using a markdown editor. A markdown editor is a software that lets you write in plain text and apply formatting with simple symbols. For example, you can use asterisks to make text bold or italic, or use hashtags to create headings. You can write and format your text in the editor mode, and then preview the final result in the preview mode.\nThere are dedicated markdown editors such as obsidian and typora which are largely used by creative and technical writers with minimal software programming background. However, some integrated development environment (IDE) like RStudio and visual studio are used as markdown editors particularly among technical writers with software programming background for code and software documentation. Most markdown formatting will work across most markdown editors however some markdown formatting are unique to the specific editors.\nMarkdown editors are different from the traditional word processors that most of us are familiar with, such as Microsoft Word. These word processors are based on the principle of “what you see is what you get” (WYSIWYG), which means that you see the formatting as you type. However, this can also be distracting and cumbersome, especially when you are working on long and complex documents.\nIn this blog post, I will give a 5 use-cases where markdown editors can help you write better long form academic documents.\n\n\n1. Increased productivity through simplified formatting\nLike most graduate students, i was well-acquainted with the ubiquitous Microsoft Word. While Word offers familiarity, accessibility through university accounts, and a range of features, it can be burdensome when it comes to formatting long documents. For instance:\n\nInserting or updating images or tables often necessitates manual adjustments in Word, including resizing and spacing corrections to maintain the document’s visual harmony.\nCopying and pasting text from various sources into Word frequently carries over formatting inconsistencies, leading to formatting discrepancies in the final document.\n\nThese challenges are undoubtedly familiar to anyone who has undertaken long-form writing projects. Please share your experiences or other similar examples in the comments below.\nIn contrast, Markdown-based tools offer an elegant solution. A simple line of code effortlessly maintains formatting consistency, regardless of the number of revisions. Markdown editors automatically update figure numbers when images are added, and all pasted text is stripped of extraneous formatting. Sub-chapters can be seamlessly reorganized, added, or removed, with automatic chapter numbering of the final document. Markdown editors empowers writers to focus their precious time on the actual writing, sparing them the drudgery of managing formatting intricacies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Markdown formatted document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) PDF printout of document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This is an example of automatic numbering of chapter headings and figure captions within markdown\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Seamless Integration of Publication-Ready Images\nConventional word processors often fall short when handling images generated from data analysis tools. These images at times may appear blurry, exhibit poor color contrast, or present image text in smaller fonts. Flow charts and schematic diagrams can be particularly troublesome, as they tend to shift or lose elements particularly when document containing them are shared among collaborators or supervisors. Let me know in the comments section if anything like this has ever happened to you.\nRStudio, a powerful data visualization tool and markdown editor, offers an elegant solution. The tool allows authors to draft text alongside the code that generates images, facilitating real-time image adjustments within the markdown environment.\nWhile creating flow charts and schematic diagrams in a traditional word processor may be straightforward, markdown editors typically incorporate tools like mermaid.js, that reduces time spent in creating and editing complex flow charts with plain text. This approach, though requiring some familiarity with mermaid syntax, streamlines the creation of intricate flow charts in a matter of minutes.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(DiagrammeR)\n\n\nmermaid(\"graph LR\n  subgraph Preparation\n  A((Start))--&gt; B(Step 1)\n  end\n  subgraph Execution\n  B --&gt; C{Step 2}\n  C --&gt; D(Step 3)\n  E(Step 4) --&gt; F(Step 5)\n  end\n  subgraph Conclusion\n  C --&gt; G(Step 6)\n  F--&gt; H[Step 7]\n  end\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This is an example of a flow digram generated in RStudio using the code chuck above. This also illustrates how data analysis outputs can be easily inserted within writeup and updated within the same environment as your writeup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Enhanced Reproducibility\nData analysis and writing are iterative processes, often involving multiple rounds of revising and refining data and writing outputs. When it comes to data analysis, additional data may become available after initial data analysis and report drafting, which may necessitate reanalysis of data or even new analysis. Managing these evolving datasets can be complex and error-prone, especially when managing different data files over time while not having good data management practices.\nIn addition, during long-form writing, numerous unformed ideas can be captured as notes within earlier document drafts which might require revisions or supporting evidence. The conventional method to manage these unformed ideas is to color-highlight these text and editing them later or deleting them (Figure 3 (c)). If you employ other methods for managing unformed ideas, please share in the comments section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) commenting in RStudio. The dark blue text is commented out using html commenting syntax and will be absent in the printed or rendered final document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Commenting in obsidian. Obsidian is a popular note-taking markdown editor that uses html as well as obsidian flavored markdown comment syntax. Obsidian flavored markdown comments might be visible in some rendered output formats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Commenting in Word. The text containing the unformed ideas is highlighted with yellow highlight and a comment added to reference action to be taken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Different ways to comment out unformed ideas within long-form write-ups\n\n\n\nHowever, deleting or editing these unformed ideas might leave you in a situation where you might need these ideas at a later date. An alternative way to managing this using markdown editors is to comment out these unformed ideas within your writing. This allows you to refer to them during later revisions however not have them visible within your printed or rendered document.\nAnother alternative is to use version control. Markdown editors, when coupled with Git and GitHub for version control, offer a powerful solution for tracking document changes. This approach allows you to have all your data analysis and writing consolidated within a single location and have historical versions of the document preserved for reference. With Git’s version control capabilities, authors can effectively manage evolving data and track changes across different document drafts.\n\n\n4. Chapter referencing\nWord while compatible with citation managers like Mendeley or Zotero, it can encounter challenges when inserting chapter-specific references at the end of each chapter within a long-form document. To facilitate insertion of references at the end of each chapter, authors often resort to creating separate chapter documents, risking citation duplications.\nMarkdown editors can circumvent this issue through using specific YAML code. The code instructs the editor to aggregate all the references cited within the specific chapter at the end of the chapter. This approach eliminates the risk of duplicated references within a single document, providing a cleaner and more accurate reference list.\n\n\n5. Document repurposing and LaTeX Support\nMarkdown editors offer effortless file conversion of a single document into various document formats using pandoc file conversion. Authors can generate research grant reports, presentations, books, or manuscripts from the same source file with minimal adjustments. This approach saves time and ensures uniformity in message communicated.\nAdditionally, markdown editors often incorporate pandoc plugins and MathJax, to simplify the inclusion of mathematical formulas and equations. Beautifully typeset LaTeX documents can be easily generated while retaining mathematical formatting via pandoc conversion with the assistance of packages like TinyTex or programs like MikTeX. This feature is particularly beneficial for researchers with scientific backgrounds that frequently use mathematical symbols and equations as part of their regular write-up.\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\nThis  \\(Persons \\; infected = \\frac{(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{liter \\; wastewater})* (\\frac{liter \\; wastewater}{days})}{(\\frac{g \\; feces}{person-day})*(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{g \\; feces})}\\)1 is an example of an equation written within a sentence.\n  This \\[Persons \\; infected = \\frac{(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{liter \\; wastewater})* (\\frac{liter \\; wastewater}{days})}{(\\frac{g \\; feces}{person-day})*(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{g \\; feces})}\\] is the same equation written between paragraphs.\n   # Syntax for above equation\n\n  Persons \\; infected = \\frac{(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{liter \\; wastewater})*     (\\frac{liter \\; wastewater}{days})}{(\\frac{g \\;feces}{person-day})*(\\frac{RNA \\; copies}{g \\; feces})}\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\nThis  \\(L_T(\\vec{\\lambda})=\\sum_{(x,s)}\\log P{(s|x)}-\\sum_{i=1}^m\\frac{\\lambda_i^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\) is an example of a mathematical equation written within a sentence.\n \nThis \\[L_T(\\vec{\\lambda})=\\sum_{(x,s)}\\log P{(s|x)}-\\sum_{i=1}^m\n\\frac{\\lambda_i^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\] is the same equation written between paragraphs.\n # Syntax for above equation\n\n  L_T(\\vec{\\lambda})=\\sum_{(x,s)}\\log P{(s|x)}-\\sum_{i=1}^m\\frac{\\lambda_i^2}{2\\sigma^2}"

This blog aims to walk you through a step-by-step process for building an interactive Shiny app using the World Health Organization’s (WHO) global HIV-1 incidence data from 1990 to 2021. Using the power of R and Shiny, dynamic visualizations can be generated that allows users to explore and analyze the changing patterns of HIV-1 incidence over time."

    "section": "Steps to building the web application",
    "text": "Steps to building the web application\n\nStep 1. Data Acquisition and Preparation\nHIV incidence data was download from the World Health Organization data repository. The dataset contained estimates for HIV prevalence, AIDS-related deaths, new HIV infections for all countries from 1990 to 2021.\nThe data was downloaded as an excel file for the data repository. The imported excel file had multiple merged cells. The columns with country names, HIV-1 incidence estimates and years were extracted to a new sheet and saved as a csv file.\n\n\nStep 2: Data cleaning and preparation\nThe csv file was imported into Rstudio and the data was grouped by country. To map the data, longitude and latitude coordinate data for each country was added to the dataset.\n\n\nStep 3: Setting up the Shiny Environment and creating the app\nTo create the shiny app, a new file type for shiny web app was created and saved in a separate folder within the working environment.\nTo create the shiny app; 3 components were needed\n\nUser interface (UI) which represents the front end of the app which the end user sees and interact with.\nServer which represent the backend of the shiny app which computes the required outputs based on the input given by the end user.\nThe shiny interface which bridges the ui and server.\n\nIn this example, the UI was made of a sidebar and main panel. The main panel had 2 tabs. The first tab shows an interactive map and with a slider for years ranging from 1990 t0 2021. Moving the slider across the year range by one level results in the map adjusting to reflect the HIV-incidence for that year. The second tab showed a graph for HIV-1 incidence from 1990 to 2021 with a drop down menu for selecting country. Selecting a country from the drop down menu resulted in the graph adjusting to reflect HIV-incidence for that country.\nFor data to be correctly filtered when a user of the shiny web app slides the slider or the user selects a country from the drop-down menu, the data imputed to the server had to be converted to a reactive object. This was then used to create two reactive apps. The first app being a reactive leaflet map which filtered HIV-1 incidence based on the year selected. HIV-1 incidence estimates is presented as a blue circle super-imposed onto the country. The second reactive app is a reactive ggplot graph which is filtered based on the country selected by the user from the drop down menu.\nThe complete code for this shiny app is as shown below\n\n# install and load packages\n\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(utils)   \nlibrary(shiny)   ## package for interactive app\nlibrary(leaflet) ## package for map\nlibrary(ggplot2) ## package for generating graph\nlibrary(dplyr)   ## package for merging, grouping and filtering data\nlibrary(ggmap)  ## package for adding longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates \nlibrary(bslib) ## package for theming shiny ui \nlibrary(thematic) # package for theming shiny ggplot\n\n\n\n# import HIV data\nhiv_data &lt;- read.csv(\"ExcelFileInCSVformat.csv\")\n\n# manipulate data using dplyr\nhiv_data &lt;- hiv_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(country) \n\n# Generate dataset with longitudes and latititudes for each country of the world\n\nworld_map &lt;- map_data(\"world\")\n\n# Add latitudes and longitudes to hiv_data\nhiv_mapped_data &lt;- merge(world_map, hiv_data, by.x = \"region\", by.y = \"country\")\n\n# filter out rows that do not have HIV incidence estimates\nhiv_map_data1 &lt;- hiv_map_data %&gt;% filter(!is.na(hiv_map_data$incidence))\n\nhiv_map_data1 &lt;- hiv_map_data1 %&gt;% \n  group_by(region)\n\n\n# create shiny app\n\n\nthematic::thematic_shiny() ## This code adds the ui theme to ggplot\n\n## UI for shiny app\nui &lt;- fluidPage(theme = bs_theme(\n  bg = \"#B8BCC2\", \n  fg = \"#34373a\", \n  primary = \"blue\", \n  secondary = \"red\",\n  base_font = font_google(\"Roboto Condensed\")),\n  sidebarLayout(sidebarPanel(titlePanel((strong(\"HIV Incidence\"))), br(), em(\"HIV incidence data for all ages from 1990 to 2021 based on Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\"), h5(\"Data source:\"), h5(a(href=\"https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/\", \"Data Repository\")), width = 3),\n  mainPanel(\n  tabsetPanel(\n    tabPanel(h5(strong(\"HIV incidence per year\")), p(\" \"), sliderInput(\"year\", strong(\"Select year:\"), min = 1990, max = 2021, value = 1995, step = 1, sep = \"\", width = \"100%\"), leafletOutput(\"map\", width = \"100%\", height = \"375px\")),\n    tabPanel(h5(strong(\"HIV incidence per country\")), br(), selectInput(\"country\", strong(\"Select a country:\"), choices = sort(unique(hiv_data$country))), plotOutput(\"plot2\", width = \"100%\", height = \"400px\"))\n  )\n)\n))\n\n## Server for shiny app\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n   \n  \n## reactive data filtered by selected year\n  filtered_data &lt;- reactive({\n    hiv_data %&gt;% filter(year == input$year)\n  })\n  filtered_data2 &lt;- reactive({\n    hiv_map_data1 %&gt;% filter(region == input$region)\n  })\n  \n  \n  ## create map\n  output$map &lt;- renderLeaflet({\n    leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 1.7, width = \"500px\", height = \"700px\"))%&gt;%\n      addTiles() %&gt;% \n      fitBounds(lng1 = 160, lat1 = -180, lng2 = -100, lat2 = 180) %&gt;%\n      setMaxBounds(lng1 = 160, lat1 = -180, lng2 = -100, lat2 = 180) %&gt;% \n      setView(lng = 40, lat = 0, zoom = 2) %&gt;%\n      addProviderTiles(\"OpenStreetMap\") %&gt;%\n      setMaxBounds(lng1 = min(hiv_data$longitude), \n                   lat1 = min(hiv_data$latitude), \n                   lng2 = max(hiv_data$longitude), \n                   lat2 = max(hiv_data$longitude)) %&gt;%\n      #setView(0,0,2) %&gt;%\n      addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %&gt;%\n      clearBounds() %&gt;%\n      addCircleMarkers(data = filtered_data(), ~longitude, ~latitude, label = ~paste0(country, sep =\"  \", incidence), radius = ~incidence*2, color = \"blue\", fillOpacity = 0.4, stroke= FALSE, )\n  })\n  \n\n## create graph\n  \n  output$plot2 &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(data = hiv_data[hiv_data$country == input$country,], aes(x = year, y = incidence)) +\n      geom_line() +\n      ggtitle(paste(\"HIV incidence for\", input$country)) + \n      labs(x = \"Years\", y = \"HIV incidence (per 1000 uninfected populations)\") + theme(text=element_text(size=15), axis.title=element_text(size=15), plot.title=element_text(size=20)) \n    \n    \n  \n  }\n  )\n}\n\n\n# run shiny app\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Deploying and Sharing the Shiny\nThe app was then uploaded to my shinyapp.io server account for easy sharing of the app."

    "text": "The role of research assistant encompassed the following responsibilities:\n\nBio-specimen processing\nOrganizing and facilitating workshops\nPost-graduate mentorship\n\n\n\nA pivotal role as a research assistant revolved around the diligent processing of bio-specimens, specifically 400 stool samples collected from infants. These bio-specimens held profound significance as they constituted an essential component of a comprehensive investigation aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of point-of-use water treatment technologies in preventing child stunting within the context of South Africa. This necessitated the implementation of an intricate system for their proper processing, storage, and tracking.\nTo ensure the integrity and traceability of the extensive bio-specimen collection, a sophisticated approach was adopted, leveraging the utilization of the Microsoft Access database. This powerful database system facilitated the accurate capture and organization of participant identification information, thereby enabling the generation of unique barcodes for each aliquot derived from every stool sample obtained at distinct time-points throughout the study duration. As a result, an intricate and foolproof tracking system was established, ensuring that each individual stool sample aliquot could be unequivocally linked to the corresponding participant. This meticulous approach played a pivotal role in facilitating accurate and reproducible research outcomes, enhancing the reliability and validity of the findings.\n\n\n\nSnap-shot of the Microsoft Acess database used for biospecimen processing\n\n\nDuring the handling of these bio-specimens, strict adherence to Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs) was meticulously followed to maintain the highest standards of scientific rigor and safety. This encompassed a range of stringent measures, including the implementation of double-gloving protocols to minimize the risk of potential contamination, the use of single-use applicators to prevent any cross-contamination, and the judicious application of 5% bleach for the disinfection of any item or surface exposed to bio-specimens before its disposal in appropriately labeled biohazard bags. Implementing these GLPs, ensured the preservation of sample integrity and minimized any potential hazards associated with the handling of bio-specimens.\n\n\n\nIn conjunction with my laboratory responsibilities, I had the distinct privilege of actively participating in the organization and facilitation of two workshops dedicated to the intestinal pathogens and next-generation sequencing (NGS).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nIn September 2016, South Africa introduced the Universal Test and Treat (UTT) programme to manage HIV infection. However, the development of drug resistance and sustaining viral suppression are challenges to the success of treatment programmes. This prospective observational study describes virologic, immunologic, and drug resistance profiles in a test and treat cohort in north-eastern South Africa.\n\n\nMethods\nFive hundred and thirty-four HIV-1 positive antiretroviral naïve adults entering treatment programmes were enrolled between January 2016 and February 2018. Trends in CD4+ cell count, viral load, and drug resistance by examination of deep sequences were assessed at baseline and every three months, for 24 months.\n\n\nResults\nSeventy-five percent were late initiators into ART (that is baseline CD4+ cell counts &lt; 500 cells/microliter) and 16% were early initiators into ART and baseline CD4 was not available for 9%. Eleven percent (12/104) achieved immunological response after 6 months, 39.4% (41/104) after 12 months, and 97.5% (101/104) after 24 months. Seventy-one percent (381/534) had baseline viral loads &gt;1000 RNA copies/ml. Nine percent (22/246) achieved viral suppression after 3 months, 50% (122/246) after 6 months and 73.6% (181/246) after 12 months. A slower viral suppression was observed for males than females (p value = 0.012). A total of 45.6% (52/114) individuals had at least one drug resistance mutation (DRM) detected at &gt;20% threshold in any of the time points, and the number increased to 55% (63/114) when minor variants were accounted for. Forty-eight percent (14/29) had drug resistance mutations at &gt;5% threshold as early as 3 months into treatment.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe UNAIDS target of 95% viral suppression in individuals under treatment was not observed after 12 months of treatment, and this was less successful for males. Adherence and drug resistance monitoring could be beneficial for individuals harboring resistant viruses early into treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{ogola2024,\n  author = {Ogola, Bixa and Matume, Nontokozo and M.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Prologue: The Hum of Discovery\n\n\n\nFor those of us living in the trenches of genomics, the resonant hum of a sequencer isn’t mere background noise—it’s the pulse of revelation. Last week, that pulse came from Illumina’s NextSeq 1000. I joined a hands-on workshop at KEMRI/CGHR, trading stale lectures for a five-day genomic bootcamp that fused theory with lab grit. This wasn’t just training; it was a masterclass in modern sequencing. Strap in: we’re dissecting DNA, algorithms, and the very edge of genomic innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllumina NextSeq 1000 humming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe workshop opened not with pipettes, but with a panoramic sweep through genomics’ defining moments. An Illumina Applications Specialist Cecilia Rumberia framed today’s tools by retracing biology’s core dogma—DNA → RNA → Protein—then marching through milestones:\n- Sanger Sequencing (1977): Artisanal, low-throughput, yet revolutionary.\n- NGS Revolution (2000s): Massively parallelized short-read sequencing.\n- The Hi-Tech Present: Platforms like NextSeq 1000, marrying speed, accuracy, and scalability.\n\n\n\nTimeline of sequencing technologies and platforms (Lu et al. 2025)\n\n\nWe weren’t just learning how to sequence; we were learning why each leap mattered. The shift from capillary electrophoresis to flow-cell clustering didn’t just accelerate science—it democratized it.\n\n\n\nOur deep dive into Illumina’s DNA Prep workflow revealed six precision-engineered steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nKey Innovation\nWhy It Matters\n\n\n\n\n1. Tagmentation\nBead-Linked Transposomes (BLT)\nFragments DNA and adds adapters in 5 minutes (vs. 1hr+ with Nextera XT)\n\n\n2. Library Amplification\nDual-indexed PCR\nUnique IDs for 384+ samples in 8 cycles\n\n\n3. Normalization\nMathematical pooling\nPrevents “lane hogging” by over-amplified samples\n\n\n4. Cluster Gen\nBridge amplification\nCreates millions of clone clusters on flow cell\n\n\n5. XLEAP-SBS\nNovel polymerase + reversible terminators\n&lt;0.1% error rate; 85%+ bases ≥ Q30\n\n\n6. Base Calling\nReal-time image analysis\nOutputs FASTQ files in minutes\n\n\n\nThe star? XLEAP-SBS chemistry. Its error-correcting polymerase felt like upgrading “from a typewriter to a quantum keyboard.” And DRAGEN (Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics)? A bioinformatics Ferrari—compressing 20-hour analyses into 60 minutes via field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) hardware acceleration. For our lab’s pathogen surveillance work, this wasn’t luxury—it was lifesaving.\n\n\n\nCecilia presenting the different Sequencing chemistries offered by illumina\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 2 vaulted us from theory into the trenches. With DNA from cultured bacteria and human isolates, we grappled with Illumina’s DNA Prep Kit. A critical lesson emerged: Input DNA is sacred. We quantified samples using Qubit Fluorometry - Targeting double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with picogram sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Qubit?\n\n\n\nWith input DNA requirements spanning 1–500 ng, a 10% error could trash a $1,000 run. Spectrophotometry (A260) misreads ssDNA, RNA, and salts as “DNA.” Qubit’s dsDNA-specific dyes prevent this—a non-negotiable for clinical-grade prep.\n\n\nArmed with 30 µL of DNA, we executed:\n\nTagmentation: Fragment DNA using Bead-linked transposomes (BLT)\nPost-tagmentation cleanup: Eliminating non-fragmented DNA\nPCR Amplification: Added unique dual indexes.\nLibrary Cleanup: washed away unused PCR products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Aha!” Moment:\n\n\n\n\nBLT’s fragmentation/adapter-ligation was revelatory. It was more efficient and resulted in uniformly sized libraries compared to what we had from older kits (Nextera XT)\n\n\nFueled by adrenaline and Kenyan coffee, we had 43 purified libraries. The sequencer awaited.\n\n\n\nDay 3 pivoted to analytics. We quantifying libraries via Qubit and then thawed the sequencing cartridge (at room temperature for 6 hours and then 16 hours at 2-8°C). Determining concentration (ng/µL) wasn’t enough—we needed fragment length to calculate molarity (nM).\nEnter the Agilent 4200 Tapestation:\n- Sample: 1 µL library → High Sensitivity D5000 screentape.\n- Output: Size distribution (peaks at 350–600 bp ideal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Tip\n\n\n\nLibraries with broad peaks or adapter dimers (&lt;100 bp) were flagged for re-cleanup. However, Our library was sheer textbook-perfect.\n\n\nNormalization required every library to hit the exact same molar concentration in the pool. One miscalculation, and precious samples vanish in the data deluge.\nWe wrestled with:\n\\[      \nMolarity \\ (nM) = \\frac{Concentration \\ (ng/µL)}{ 660 g/mol\\ × \\ Average\\ fragment\\ Size \\ (bp)} × 10^6\n\\]\nThen applied dilution factors to standardize all libraries to 4 nM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Element\n\n\n\nAmid frantic Excel formulas, a colleague joked: “Avogadro’s constant was a long lost school memory.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWith normalized libraries, we:\n1. Pooled 43 samples into one tube.\n2. Re-quantified the pool: 1.9 ng/µL (Qubit).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tension:\n\n\n\n\n1.9 ng/µL was just below our 2 ng/µL target. A sigh of relief—it meant no re-pooling.\n\n\n\nConfirmed size: 538 bp (Tapestation).\n\nDiluted the library to 2 nM then 750 picomolar\nDiluted PhiX control to 760 picomolar\nWe spiked in 5% PhiX Control—Illumina’s gold standard for:\n\nCluster Density Calibration: Optimizes signal-to-noise.\n\nError Rate Validation: Measures base-calling accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy spike with PhiX?\n\n\n\nLow-diversity libraries (e.g., amplicons) confuse sequencers. PhiX’s random sequence “teaches” the instrument phasing/prephasing parameters.\n\n\nFinal steps:\n1. Attached flow cell to the cartridge and load sample 2. Slid the cartridge into the NextSeq 1000.\n2. The screen flashed: “Run Started. 22h Remaining.”\n\n\n\nDay 5 was a day that the sequencer hummed its final note by generating an output of 148.76 Gigabases (3.46 Gb/sample) with 87.07% Bases ≥ Q30 (exceeding Illumina’s 85% guarantee).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecoding Q30\n\n\n\nA Q30 score means a 0.1% error probability (1 wrong base/1,000). For variant calling in pathogens, this isn’t stats—it’s diagnostic certainty.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup photo next to the NextSeq 1000\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we packed our lab coats, that sequencer hum lingered—a sonic emblem of biology’s new era. The NextSeq 1000 isn’t merely a tool; it’s a paradigm shift. With XLEAP-SBS accuracy, DRAGEN speed, and workflows forgiving enough for 1 ng inputs, genomics isn’t just for mega-labs anymore.\nThis workshop didn’t just teach protocols. It proved that today in Kenya, we can sequence with the precision of Boston or Berlin. And that sound—the sound of equity in discovery—is the hum worth chasing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop group"

An Illumina Applications Specialist Cecilia Rumberia framed today’s tools by retracing biology’s core dogma—DNA → RNA → Protein—then marching through milestones:\n- Sanger Sequencing (1977): Artisanal, low-throughput, yet revolutionary.\n- NGS Revolution (2000s): Massively parallelized short-read sequencing.\n- The Hi-Tech Present: Platforms like NextSeq 1000, marrying speed, accuracy, and scalability.\n\n\n\nTimeline of sequencing technologies and platforms (Lu et al. 2025)\n\n\nWe weren’t just learning how to sequence; we were learning why each leap mattered. The shift from capillary electrophoresis to flow-cell clustering didn’t just accelerate science—it democratized it.\n\n\n\nOur deep dive into Illumina’s DNA Prep workflow revealed six precision-engineered steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nKey Innovation\nWhy It Matters\n\n\n\n\n1. Tagmentation\nBead-Linked Transposomes (BLT)\nFragments DNA and adds adapters in 5 minutes (vs. 1hr+ with Nextera XT)\n\n\n2. Library Amplification\nDual-indexed PCR\nUnique IDs for 384+ samples in 8 cycles\n\n\n3. Normalization\nMathematical pooling\nPrevents “lane hogging” by over-amplified samples\n\n\n4. Cluster Gen\nBridge amplification\nCreates millions of clone clusters on flow cell\n\n\n5. XLEAP-SBS\nNovel polymerase + reversible terminators\n&lt;0.1% error rate; 85%+ bases ≥ Q30\n\n\n6. Base Calling\nReal-time image analysis\nOutputs FASTQ files in minutes\n\n\n\nThe star? XLEAP-SBS chemistry. Its error-correcting polymerase felt like upgrading “from a typewriter to a quantum keyboard.” And DRAGEN (Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics)? A bioinformatics Ferrari—compressing 20-hour analyses into 60 minutes via field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) hardware acceleration. For our lab’s pathogen surveillance work, this wasn’t luxury—it was lifesaving.\n\n\n\nCecilia presenting the different Sequencing chemistries offered by illumina\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 2 vaulted us from theory into the trenches. With DNA from cultured bacteria and human isolates, we grappled with Illumina’s DNA Prep Kit. A critical lesson emerged: Input DNA is sacred. We quantified samples using Qubit Fluorometry - Targeting double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with picogram sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Qubit?\n\n\n\nWith input DNA requirements spanning 1–500 ng, a 10% error could trash a $1,000 run. Spectrophotometry (A260) misreads ssDNA, RNA, and salts as “DNA.” Qubit’s dsDNA-specific dyes prevent this—a non-negotiable for clinical-grade prep.\n\n\nArmed with 30 µL of DNA, we executed:\n\nTagmentation: Fragment DNA using Bead-linked transposomes (BLT)\nPost-tagmentation cleanup: Eliminating non-fragmented DNA\nPCR Amplification: Added unique dual indexes.\nLibrary Cleanup: washed away unused PCR products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Aha!” Moment:\n\n\n\n\nBLT’s fragmentation/adapter-ligation was revelatory. It was more efficient and resulted in uniformly sized libraries compared to what we had from older kits (Nextera XT)\n\n\nFueled by adrenaline and Kenyan coffee, we had 43 purified libraries. The sequencer awaited.\n\n\n\nDay 3 pivoted to analytics. We quantifying libraries via Qubit and then thawed the sequencing cartridge (at room temperature for 6 hours and then 16 hours at 2-8°C). Determining concentration (ng/µL) wasn’t enough—we needed fragment length to calculate molarity (nM).\nEnter the Agilent 4200 Tapestation:\n- Sample: 1 µL library → High Sensitivity D5000 screentape.\n- Output: Size distribution (peaks at 350–600 bp ideal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Tip\n\n\n\nLibraries with broad peaks or adapter dimers (&lt;100 bp) were flagged for re-cleanup. However, Our library was sheer textbook-perfect.\n\n\nNormalization required every library to hit the exact same molar concentration in the pool. One miscalculation, and precious samples vanish in the data deluge.\nWe wrestled with:\n\\[      \nMolarity \\ (nM) = \\frac{Concentration \\ (ng/µL)}{ 660 g/mol\\ × \\ Average\\ fragment\\ Size \\ (bp)} × 10^6\n\\]\nThen applied dilution factors to standardize all libraries to 4 nM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Element\n\n\n\nAmid frantic Excel formulas, a colleague joked: “Avogadro’s constant was a long lost school memory.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWith normalized libraries, we:\n1. Pooled 43 samples into one tube.\n2. Re-quantified the pool: 1.9 ng/µL (Qubit).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tension:\n\n\n\n\n1.9 ng/µL was just below our 2 ng/µL target. A sigh of relief—it meant no re-pooling.\n\n\n\nConfirmed size: 538 bp (Tapestation).\n\nDiluted the library to 2 nM then 750 picomolar\nDiluted PhiX control to 760 picomolar\nWe spiked in 5% PhiX Control—Illumina’s gold standard for:\n\nCluster Density Calibration: Optimizes signal-to-noise.\n\nError Rate Validation: Measures base-calling accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy spike with PhiX?\n\n\n\nLow-diversity libraries (e.g., amplicons) confuse sequencers. PhiX’s random sequence “teaches” the instrument phasing/prephasing parameters.\n\n\nFinal steps:\n1. Attached flow cell to the cartridge and load sample 2. Slid the cartridge into the NextSeq 1000.\n2. The screen flashed: “Run Started. 22h Remaining.”\n\n\n\nDay 5 was a day that the sequencer hummed its final note by generating an output of 148.76 Gigabases (3.46 Gb/sample) with 87.07% Bases ≥ Q30 (exceeding Illumina’s 85% guarantee).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecoding Q30\n\n\n\nA Q30 score means a 0.1% error probability (1 wrong base/1,000). For variant calling in pathogens, this isn’t stats—it’s diagnostic certainty.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup photo next to the NextSeq 1000\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we packed our lab coats, that sequencer hum lingered—a sonic emblem of biology’s new era. The NextSeq 1000 isn’t merely a tool; it’s a paradigm shift. With XLEAP-SBS accuracy, DRAGEN speed, and workflows forgiving enough for 1 ng inputs, genomics isn’t just for mega-labs anymore.\nThis workshop didn’t just teach protocols. It proved that today in Kenya, we can sequence with the precision of Boston or Berlin. And that sound—the sound of equity in discovery—is the hum worth chasing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop group"
